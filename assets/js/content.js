<h1>My work is inspired by the backyard bonfire storytelling tradition with technology at the center of mesmerizing, immersive environments. I leverage digital tools to create analog, communal experiences with hypnotic interactivity – similar to playing with the sparks in the fire – as you are transported by a storyteller's account or musical accompaniment. My process normally begins by leaving the studio with a camera, mic and laptop and venturing into the serendipitous wilds of backroads outposts, purposefully veering from the common sense of guidebooks and mainstream destinations, like the best bonfire tales do. The media and stories I collect often manifest as browser-based storyworlds experienced across platforms from Augmented Reality, projection mapping installations, Web VR, video edits created to inspire the adventure and wanderlust.</h1>
